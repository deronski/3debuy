            <b>Triton(Son Of Poseidon)</b><br/>
            Triton, the son of Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea, was a merman with a human torso and the tail of a fish.
             He was known for his powerful voice, which he used to blow a conch shell to control the waves. One day, Triton was swimming in the Mediterranean Sea when he saw a beautiful naiad, 
             a nymph of fresh water. He was immediately smitten with her, and he followed her to the River Danube. When they reached Vienna, Triton saw that the naiad was being held captive by a group of humans.
              He used his powerful voice to scare the humans away, and he then rescued the naiad. 
            The naiad was so grateful to Triton that she agreed to marry him. They lived happily ever after in a beautiful underwater palace in the River Danube.</p>
        <p id="info2">
            <b style=" font-family: Poppins, Arial, sans-serif;">Naiad</b><br/>
            Once upon a time, there was a naiad who lived in the Danube River. She loved to swim and play in the water, and she would often sing to the fish and other creatures that lived in the river.
             One day, the naiad saw a beautiful fountain in the middle of Vienna. She had never seen anything like it before, and she was immediately drawn to it. She swam up to the fountain and looked at it closely. 
             She saw that it was a statue of a Triton and a Naiad. The Triton was a merman with a fish tail, and the Naiad was a beautiful woman with a long flowing hair. 
             The naiad was so impressed by the fountain that she decided to stay in Vienna.
        </p>
        <p id="info3">
            <b style=" font-family: Poppins, Arial, sans-serif;">Putto</b><br/>
            Putti are cherubic figures that are often depicted in art and architecture. They are often seen as symbols of innocence and playfulness. In the Vienna Triton and Naiad Fountain, 
            the putto is holding a fish, which is a symbol of fertility and abundance. 
            The putto's presence in the fountain is a reminder of the importance of these two things in life.
        </p>
        <p id="info4">
            <b style=" font-family: Poppins, Arial, sans-serif;">Crocodile</b><br/>
            Putti are cherubic figures that are often depicted in art and architecture. They are often seen as symbols of innocence and playfulness. In the Vienna Triton and Naiad Fountain, 
            the putto is holding a fish, which is a symbol of fertility and abundance. 
            The putto's presence in the fountain is a reminder of the importance of these two things in life.
        </p>
        <p id="info5">
            <b style=" font-family: Poppins, Arial, sans-serif;">Fish</b><br/>
            The crocodile in the Vienna Triton and Naiad Fountain sculpture is a symbol of the Nile River. The Nile River was a major source of water and life for ancient Egypt, 
            and the crocodile was a sacred animal to the Egyptians. The crocodile in the fountain is a reminder of the importance of water and the power of nature.

            In addition, the crocodile can also be seen as a symbol of danger and the unknown. The crocodile is a predator that is often seen as a threat to humans.
            The presence of the crocodile in the fountain can be seen as a warning to be careful and to respect the power of nature.
        </p>
        <p id="info6">
            <b style=" font-family: Poppins, Arial, sans-serif;">Turtle</b><br/>
            Turtles are known for their long lifespans, and they are often seen as a symbol of wisdom and knowledge. In the fountain, 
            the turtle is positioned at the base, which suggests that it is a foundation of the sculpture. This suggests that the turtle represents the strength and stability of the city of Vienna. 
            The turtle is also facing the viewer, which suggests that it is a symbol of protection. This suggests that the turtle is protecting the city from harm.

            Additionally, the turtle is often associated with the element of water, which is also present in the fountain. Water is a symbol of life, and it is often seen as a source of cleansing and purification. 
            In the fountain, the water is flowing from the turtle's mouth, which suggests that the turtle is a source of life and renewal. 
            This suggests that the turtle is a symbol of hope and optimism for the future of the city of Vienna.
